You will need git installed. You can use a git GUI (e.g sourcetree). However I will work with and show the cmd-line commands.

### Create a repo
When get onto move advanced topics, we will provide some code for you. For now you should create a blank git repo on you git host of choice ([Github](github.com), [BitBucket](bitbucket.org), or Napier's Gitlab: [gitgud.napier.ac.uk](gitgud.napier.ac.uk) )

### Clone it down

{:tip="sshkeys" class="tip"}
Are you using ssh keys? you should be.

`git clone git@github.com:you/yourRepo.git`
