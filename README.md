## How does this repo  work?

All the lectures ands labs are written in Markdown with some html sprinkled in. Jekyll is used to turn this into full html webpages and pdfs. Github pages does this, and serves it at the github.io link. The lectures use Reveal.js to make the html page look super fancy, this is all done in-browser.

If you want to generate this site locally: 
You'll need Ruby, 
- Clone it down
- Get Bundler if you don't already have it. ``` gem install bundler ```
- ```bundle install```
- ```bundle exec jekyll serve```
