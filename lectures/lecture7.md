What is a Game Design Document?
===============================

What is the Game Design Document?

-   Game Design Document (GDD) is the template for the game that is to
    be created.

-   The GDD is the main reference when determining how things should be
    done when developing the game.

-   However, it is not a sacred document.

    -   It is a living, constantly changing document.

    -   Updates are made as the development progresses.

-   It can get quite large.

    -   Over 1,000 pages in some circumstances.

-   Team size and document size leads to using online collaboration
    approaches.

    -   Wiki usage common.

General Content

-   There is no standard format. It can be very company specific.

-   Some guidelines are out there (for example Fullerton).

-   Sections we will produce:

    -   Overview and vision statement.

        -   Broad overview of the game. Game designer's vision.

    -   Audience, platform, and marketing.

        -   Who is the game aimed at? What is the core demographic?

        -   Marketing is generally responsibility of the marketing
            department.

    -   Gameplay.

        -   Large important section detailing how the game plays. Game
            designer puts together their vision for this section.

General Content

.5

-   Sections we will produce (continued):

    -   Characters.

        -   What characters exist in the game? Consider both playable
            and non-playable characters.

    -   Story.

        -   What is the back story and the story told during the game?

    -   World.

        -   Description of the world where the game exists.

Exercise -- Researching Design Documents Use Google to search for game
design documents. There are quite a few out there and some templates.
You are unlikely to find modern AAA games due to the collaborative
approach and NDA requirements. If you do find a AAA one let us know.

Contents -- Design History

.5

-   Design History.

    -   GDD is a living document.

    -   Updates to the document should be described at the beginning of
        the document.

    -   Version history should be maintained.

        -   Version 1.0.

        -   Version 2.0.

        -   Version 2.1.

Overview
--------

Audience, Platform, and Marketing

-   This is an important section for the game publisher.

-   Market research must be undertaken to determine the likely return to
    the publisher.

    -   Unit sales are the most important factor from the publisher's
        point of view.

    -   The quality of the game comes second.

    -   Catering for a small, niche market is unlikely to win over a
        game publisher.

-   You need to define the target audience.

    -   Who will buy the game?

    -   What is the core demographic?

    -   How large is the audience and how likely are they to buy?

-   You also need to choose the target platform(s).

    -   What are the target platforms?

    -   Why have these been chosen?

    -   Ensure this matches with the target audience.

-   You also need to define the hardware requirements.

    -   Does your game have specific hardware requirements?

    -   Very important for PC games.

Contents -- Legal Analysis

-   A very important that you ensure everything is covered from a legal
    point of view.

-   Are there any legal or financial implications that come with the
    game production.

    -   Licence agreements.

    -   Copyright considerations.

    -   Engine/library terms and conditions.

-   Typically, Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) will be with the
    publisher, not the studio.

    -   Depends where the idea originally came from.

-   Game engines typically require statements of use, are expensive, and
    may require a per unit sale cost.

Copyright Issues

.6

-   IP owners are very protective.

    -   Game companies included.

-   When creating your game consider:

    -   Where you sourced your content from.

    -   If the content is very similar to existing content.

    -   If the game is very similar to others on the market.

    -   If you have given due credit to any external tools, libraries,
        etc., you have used.

-   Paying homage to something is all well and good but can get you into
    trouble.

Gameplay
--------

Contents -- Gameplay

-   The description of gameplay is initially one of the largest sections
    in the game.

-   The game designer puts most of their focus into this section at the
    start.

-   This section will focus on how the game plays.

-   The Formal Elements and systems view will be useful here.

-   Overview section:

    -   Description of the core functionality.

    -   Good practice is to base this on a physical or digital
        prototype.

-   Gameplay description section:

    -   A detailed description of how the game plays.

-   Controls section:

    -   User interfaces.

    -   Rules (including some from Formal Elements).

    -   Scoring / winning conditions.

    -   Single-player, multi-player, etc.

    -   Other features that may affect gameplay.

-   Levels.

    -   Designs for any levels for the game.

    -   The more detailed the level descriptions the better.

Characters
----------

Contents -- Character Design

.5 ![image](characters){width="\textwidth"}

Contents -- Character Types

-   Generally two types of character in a game.

    -   Can have a lot of work spent on them.

    -   Generally very detailed -- particularly in games where you see
        the character all the time.

-   Non-playable characters.

    -   Treat these as objects in your game with properties and
        functionality.

    -   Includes:

        -   Monsters and enemies.

Maintenance
-----------

Contents -- Maintenance

.5

-   Game Design Document (GDD) is not a sacred object.

    -   Living document.

    -   Updates made as development progresses.

-   GDD can also get quite large.

    -   Thousands of pages in some circumstances.

-   Game development can have large teams.

    -   Over a hundred people in some circumstances.

-   Document coordination is difficult in such circumstances.

.5 ![image](script){width="\textwidth"}

Using Wikis and Repositories

-   Some are using a wiki to coordinate and communicate between team
    members.

    -   Allows multiple users to update.

    -   Allows all users to access the most up to date documentation.

    -   Software development using these often as well -- see wikis on
        GitHub.

-   Repository systems can also be used.

    -   Combine document maintenance with code maintenance.

    -   Could also be storing assets.

-   Using tools allows for a structured and managed approach to the
    development process.

    -   Collaboration.

    -   Communication.

-   Use tools as necessary throughout your development process.
